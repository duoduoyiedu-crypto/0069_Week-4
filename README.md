**Student:** Duoduo Yi  
**Module:** GEOL0069 – Machine Learning in Earth Observation  

This repository contains my Week 4 assignment on unsupervised learning methods
(K-means and Gaussian Mixture Models) applied to sea-ice and lead classification
using Sentinel-2 imagery and Sentinel-3 altimetry data.

The main notebook is:

- `Chapter1_Unsupervised_Learning_Duoduo Yi.ipynb` (open with Google Colab)

More detailed introduction, methods, results and discussion will be written below.
